    <h2><b>NavyBlue Monkey</b></h2>
    <p>Despite its name, the blue monkey does not actually look extremely blue; it has sparse facial hair that occasionally gives it a blue tint, but it never looks as brightly blue as, say, a mandrill. The majority of the body is olive or grey, with the exception of the "diadem," the blackish crown, feet, and front legs, as well as the mantle, which varies in color depending on the subspecies. The usual length is 50 to 65 cm, with the exception of the tail, which is nearly as long as the entire animal. Males and females both weigh somewhat more than 4 kg.</p>
